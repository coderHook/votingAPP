Voting App - Dynamic Web Application

## Synopsis

This is a Dynamic Web application that allow users, once they sign in:
  - Create new Polls
  - Administrate their Polls.
  - Vote on other polls.


## Progress

  -24/07/2016: Main interface done.

## Motivation

With this project I hope to keep developing my "M.E.N" skills, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js and start experimenting with some other frameworks such as Angular or React //Still not knowing what to choose//

## Installation

The app will be installed in Heroku.
To run it locally:

  node app.js

## Tests

Once we are on the index.html we have to choose whether to sing up! for a new account or login if we already have an account.

In the dashboard you will be able to Administrate your pulls, create new ones and Vote.

Also there will be a sharing button to share it with your social networks.
